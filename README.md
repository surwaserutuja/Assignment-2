  {
    question: "How do I integrate CDP with my website?",
    answer: "To integrate CDP with your website, follow these steps: ...",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the steps to create a customer segment?",
    answer: "Creating a customer segment involves ...",
  },
  // Add more questions and answers here
